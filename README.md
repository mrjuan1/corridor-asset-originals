Corridor asset originals
========================
Original files used to generate the .bin and .data files found in https://github.com/youka2/corridor

Still not accepting any contributions, and this project is still licensed under the zlib license.

Files
=====
```
corridor*.blend
```
Original Blender projects. corridor.blend is where all the .bin files were exported from. The other is more of a workspace in which the model was created.

```
corridor*.png and door.png
```
Original (and simple) textures used where required in the original model, before baking.

```
test-render.png
```
Test render was my goal for this project (very unrealistic, I know) that was never reached. This was rendered out in Blender.

```
baked.png
```
baked.png is the texture baked from Blender used in this project. Gives good-looking lighting at no extra cost~
